# What is this?
This is a simple script to change all repositories visibility to private.

# Do I need it?
This script is not necessary, you can always manually change repositories visibility but it might be boring if you have a huge amount of repos.

# What do I need to use it?
All you need is your GitHub username and a Token(Classic).

# How can I get a Token?
You can generate it here --> https://github.com/settings/tokens
For security reasons I suggest you to generate a token with a short expiration date.

# How can I use it?
You need to download the repository and run the executable.

# Will it be updated?
Yes, it will be updated with more features!
