# What is this?
This is a simple script to change all repositories visibility to private.

#Do I need it?
This script is not necessary, you can always manually change repositories visibility but it might be boring if you have a huge amount of repos.

#What do I need to use it?
You need just your GitHub username and a Token(Classic).

#How can I get a Token?
You can generate it here --> https://github.com/settings/tokens
For security reasons I suggest you to generate a token with a short expiration date.

#Will it be updated?
Yes, it will be updated with more features!
